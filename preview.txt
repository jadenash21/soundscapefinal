For my Soundscape Narrative, I have chosen to detail the highly nervous energy environment that is a hospital. Although the hospital is a place where people go to seek restoration and wellness, the hospital is actually a highly overwhelming place. Not only are hospitals eery, robotic, and industrial, they are stressful and noisy. In an attempt to examine how hospital sounds negatively affect a person, I will create a soundscape that will take place in a hospital to see if these particular sounds induce anxiety, worry, or stress on a person that finds themself in this environment.
	In the previous preview of my soundscape, I had layered two clips of typical sounds that a person may encounter in a hospital. In the preview, a listener heard the sound of background noise. They noticed how fast-paced the environment was because of the plethora of sounds one can hear. One can note how busy and crowded this space is. To increase anxiety levels of the listener, I added a clip of a life support monitor. This life support monitor was used to officially identify that a person was listening to the sounds of a hospital. 
When it was time for me to record my own sounds, I walked around UPMC Presbyterian to gather more subtle sounds that would build suspense for the listener. I decided that walking around the campus of the hospital would be effective for my project because whenever people are headed to the hospital for whatever reason, the anticipation of arriving and hearing the helicopters, ambulances, and people walking around signals that they are fastly approaching a hospital. 
In my soundscape, I also included an original recording of a cafe and a bathroom just to show how industrial,mechanical, and rigid a hospital environment can be. At no point in my soundscape is the listener going to enjoy what they are hearing.
	As I put the final touches on my  soundscape, I am planning on gathering more sounds to create a proper hospital experience.
